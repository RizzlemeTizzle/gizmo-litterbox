# Analytics Workspace

Use this folder to keep measurement artifacts in sync.

## Contents
- `dashboards/` – Exports or JSON definitions for Looker Studio / Data Studio / Metabase.
- `measurement-plan.md` (TBD) – Event taxonomy, KPIs, reporting cadence.
- `data-pulls/` (TBD) – CSV dumps from Bol, Amazon, Shopify/etc.

## Immediate needs
1. Confirm GA4 + server events for site purchase funnel.
2. Centralize Bol + Amazon sales exports (monthly cadence).
3. Build blended revenue dashboard (site + marketplaces + wholesale pipeline).
