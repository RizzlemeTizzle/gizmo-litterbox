# Growth & Channel Plan (Draft)

## Objectives (Q1–Q2 2026)
1. **10× site traffic** while maintaining ≥2.5% checkout conversion.
2. **Bol.com + Amazon**: sustain ≥3.5% CVR, add 100+ new reviews with UGC.
3. **Wholesale pipeline**: sign first 3 premium retailers/distributors in NL.

## Audience segments
| Segment | Country | Key pain | Message angle |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Design-forward cat parents | NL/DE | Ugly litter boxes ruin interiors | “Design-first litter box that looks like furniture.” |
| Odor-sensitive households | NL/FR | Apartment odor / partners complaining | “Goodbye cat smell – pellet system traps ammonia.” |
| Multi-cat families | NL/DE/SE | Heavy use, leaks, messy floors | “Large, leak-free box built for big sprayers.” |

## Channels & Plays
- **Paid Social (Meta/TikTok):** UGC-style demos, before/after smell stories, interior shots. Localize NL/DE first.

- **Influencer/UGC:** Partner with NL interior creators + cat behaviorists for credible walkthroughs.
