# Reasons NOT to Buy GIZMO (Disqualifier List)

Use this guide to qualify leads, refine messaging, and repel mismatched customers. Each point can later be reframed into a positive selling angle.

1. **No interest in interior aesthetics**  
   - If the litter box lives hidden in a shed or basement, the premium design is overkill.  
   - *Mismatch:* purely functional buyers who don’t care about visual impact.

2. **Price-first mindset**  
   - Prefers €20 plastic trays and is fine replacing them often.  
   - *Mismatch:* minimal-budget shoppers who don’t value longevity or materials.

3. **Refusal to try wood pellets**  
   - GIZMO shines with pellet-based odor control. Owners unwilling to switch (or cats that absolutely refuse pellets) won’t see the benefit.  
   - *Mismatch:* gritty-litter purists.

4. **Micro living spaces**  
   - Footprint favors cat comfort, not tiny studios that need compact boxes.  
   - *Mismatch:* homes where every centimeter counts.

5. **Zero appetite for routine change**  
   - Even though maintenance is simple, it’s different from scoop-and-dump trays.  
   - *Mismatch:* owners who won’t adjust cleaning habits.

6. **Expectation of tech automation**  
   - No motors, sensors, or auto-rakes: GIZMO is manual-by-intent.  
   - *Mismatch:* buyers seeking Litter-Robot style gadgets.

7. **Extremely anxious cats**  
   - Most cats adapt fast, but those traumatized by any change may resist any new box.  
   - *Mismatch:* households where nothing new is tolerated.

8. **Desire for invisible litter solutions**  
   - GIZMO elevates the look of a visible litter box; it doesn’t hide it completely.  
   - *Mismatch:* owners wanting hidden cabinets or closets-only setups.

9. **Outdoor use cases**  
   - Built for interiors, not backyards or exposed areas.  
   - *Mismatch:* people wanting all-weather durability.

10. **No appreciation for premium quality**  
    - Robust build, matte finish, leak-proofing—lost on those who see no difference between cheap and crafted products.  
    - *Mismatch:* “plastic is plastic” buyers.

### How to use
- Integrate into sales qualification scripts and FAQ (“When is GIZMO not for you?”).
- Flip each disqualifier into a value prop for the right audience (e.g., “We obsess over interiors because you do too.”).
- Train support to recognize mismatch early and guide folks to better-suited options.
