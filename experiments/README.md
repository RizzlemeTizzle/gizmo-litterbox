# Experiment Log

Document every growth/product experiment here so we can learn quickly.

## Template
Create a subfolder per experiment: `experiments/2026-02-meta-ugc/README.md`

```
# Title
- Owner
- Start / End dates
- Hypothesis
- Channels / Surfaces
- Metric & target lift
- Implementation steps
- Results (quant + qual)
- Next action
```

## Backlog ideas
- NL Meta UGC ads focused on interior design.
- Landing page split test: odor-control story vs. interior design story.
- Bundle offer (litter box + pellet starter kit) vs. solo box.
- Bol review incentive email 7 days post-delivery.
